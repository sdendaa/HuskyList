Use Cases Implemented

- Use case 1: Register a User

- Use case 2: View Ads
	- From the main page users can click on the category they wish to view (book is the only working one at the moment). The next screen will show all of the items for sale under the corresponding category. Clicking on one of the items will lead users to the final screen which contains the actual item ad. Here users can view all of item details and contact the seller.

- Use case 3: Contact Seller 
	- Users who are interested in a item can contact the seller. This is done by navigating to the item ad (explained in Use case 2), and clicking on the "EMAIL SELLER" button. Clicking this will open an email prompt that users use to send their email. NOTE: Users must have an email account setup on their devices. 

- Use case 4: Login
	- Once users follow the steps in Use case 1 and create an account they are now able to login to the app using the same information.
